# FNF - PaoPao Engine (PaoPao's Psych Engine fork)

## What added to this fork
- Hython [WIP] - A Python-like language as mod scripting language (but I keep lua for old mods for compatibility)
> Hython is Python interpreted language, which is more readable and easier to learn than Lua? It's also more powerful and flexible than Lua.
> WIP is a work in progress, and it's not yet ready for use.
