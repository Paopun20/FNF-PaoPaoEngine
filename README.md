# FNF - PaoPao Engine (PaoPao's Psych Engine fork)

## What was added/changed in this fork

- Python [WIP] - Python as a mod scripting language
  > Python is a high-level, interpreted language that is more readable and easier to learn than Lua. It's also more powerful and flexible than Lua.\
  Why WIP? Because some Python futures contracts are not yet complete.\
  Want help? Submit a pull request [here](https://github.com/Paopun20/Hython) <- this Hython is a Python interpreter written in Haxe
- Fixed Loading Screen race condition and made it thread-safe
  > A race condition occurs when two or more threads access a shared resource simultaneously, leading to unpredictable behavior or data corruption.\
